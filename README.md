# Retro Green Dark

<!-- Plugin description -->
A dark green UI theme for IntelliJ IDE provides a stylish and visually soothing environment for coding. The theme's deep green color scheme can help reduce eye strain and improve contrast, making it easier to read code for long periods of time.

Green is a particularly important color for human eye perception because it falls in the middle of the visible light spectrum, meaning our eyes can easily detect it. Additionally, green is associated with nature and balance, which can have a calming effect on our minds and help improve focus during coding sessions.

In the design of the theme, there is an intentional attempt to strike a balance between retro-looking greens reminiscent of old computers and modern UI elements that highlight important parts of the code and IDE. This balance is achieved through the use of carefully chosen shades of green, which give a nod to the past while also providing a modern and functional look and feel while staying simple and minimalistic.

Currently, theme is in experimental, "work in progress" stage.
